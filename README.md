# C# DivideByZeroException Example

This repository contains a simple C# example demonstrating a common runtime exception: `DivideByZeroException`. The example showcases how to trigger this exception and how to handle it effectively using exception handling mechanisms in C#.

## Bug Description
The `bug.cs` file shows the flawed code which tries to divide an integer by zero. This operation results in a `DivideByZeroException`, halting the program's execution.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.cs` file presents a corrected version. It demonstrates proper exception handling using a `try-catch` block, preventing the program from crashing when encountering a division-by-zero scenario. 

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio.
3. Build and run the project. Observe the output both for the buggy and the corrected version.
